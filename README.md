# webpack-html-boilerplate

This is a basic html project boilerplate for webpack with babel and webpack-dev-server support. To use it, do the following:

1. Clone the repository to your new directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies.
3. Run `npm run serve` to start webpack-dev-server for local development.
4. Run `npm run build` to generate the static files ready for deployment to your production server.
